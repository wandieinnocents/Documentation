let’s see how to install and configure react-native development environment on Windows. If you want to know how to install react-native on Mac, see the blog post below.

you can use `Expo CLI` and `React Native CLI` to develop react-native app on Windows.

Expo CLI is the package includes many native features(geolocation, camera, etc) when you develop the app with react-native. At the first time, when you develop the react native with Expo CLI, you can feel easy and comfortable. However, this pacakge includes many native features those you don’t use, and that makes the app build size bigger. Also, if you want to integrate the native feature which Expo CLI doesn’t include, it’s hard to make it. Therefore, this blog post doesn’t recommend to use Expo CLI.

This blog post is about how to install and configure React Native CLI environment. Also, we’ll create react-native project by React Native CLI and check it works well.

We need to install Nodejs, Watchman, Xcode, etc to develop the app by react-native. let’s see how to install them one by one.
